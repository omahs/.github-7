# WAX OIG 

Welcome to the official Code Repository for the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). This repository serves as a centralized hub for storing and sharing code developed by the OIG team to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and effectiveness of our operations.

The OIG Code Repository is a testament to our commitment to open-source principles, collaboration, and knowledge sharing.

By centralizing our code in this repository, we aim to foster collaboration both within the OIG and with external stakeholders. We encourage fellow government agencies, researchers, developers, and interested individuals to explore our projects, contribute to their development, and utilize them to advance their own initiatives in the public sector.
